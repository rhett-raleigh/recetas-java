# Recetas Java

This project was used to demo some features of [Spring Boot Web](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/web/index.html)

For now, this project just has a few routes to view and create recipes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Java 21

To build
`./gradlew build`

To run
`./gradlew bootRun`

You should now be able to see the sample recipes by making a request to `GET http://localhost:8083/recipes`
